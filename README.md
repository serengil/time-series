# timeseries

This project includes implementations of several time series forecasting approaches such as Triple, Double and Single Exponential Smoothing. Moreover, different metrics are calculated to evaluate the prediction success such as Mean Absolute Error and Correlation Coefficient.

Run files located under the package "com.forecast.activity" to build forecasting.

Finally, non-linear sinus wave values are applied to forecast.
